Most of this style is stolen from https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Coding-Guidelines

# Indentation
Use spaces exclusively.  1 tab = 4 spaces.

# Names
* Use PascalCase for `type` names
* Use PascalCase for `enum` values
* Use camelCase for `function` and `method` names
* Use camelCase for `property` names and `local variables`
* Use whole words in names when possible

# Strings
* Use "double quotes" for strings shown to the user
* Use 'single quotes' otherwise

# Style
* Always surround loop and conditional bodies with curly braces
* Open curly braces always go on the same line as whatever necessitates them
