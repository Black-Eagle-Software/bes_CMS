## BES CMS Development Roadmap

Releases list below is a guideline, and should not be thought of as final until a release is completed.  Some features shown may be delayed to later releases, or may be pulled up to be part of an earlier release.  Releases shown may only be the first release of a series of bug-fix releases (i.e.: `1.0.0` may spawn the release of `1.0.1` when issues are found).

| Release | Details |
|---------|---------|
| 1.0.0   | Initial release.  Media uploading, processing implemented. User can add tags, create albums, add media to albums.  User can select media to download as a zip, delete media they upload. |
| 1.1.0   | Add hashing overlay to media tiles for `Find similar media` results.  Confirm and document release workflow. |
